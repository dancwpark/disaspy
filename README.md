# disaspy
playing around with python and capstone until magic happens

## Current status
This is purely academic/hobby "project" for understanding how a disassembler works and is implemented for now. The code is in no way my own creation.

### Resources
I am heavily using the following resources:
* https://github.com/bloodstalker/delf
* Practical Binary Analysis: by Dennis Andriesse
* elf - Linux man page
